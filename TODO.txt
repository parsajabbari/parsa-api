Figure out how to make a self-contained workspace that has all extensions
and VS Code config built-in... just clone and everything should just work. Also
useful for working across new/different devices. Key is that it should work for
anyone given access... shouldn't be only available to my account.

1. Tailwind CSS Intellisense extension to be auto-installed
2. Add tailwindcss as file association for .css files so that VSCode doesn't
complain about unknown rules like @tailwind, @apply
"files.associations": {
  "*.css": "tailwindcss"
}

Why is it that 'href="/dist/output.css"' looks at the root of the file system?
I thought it would be the root of the repo... is there a way to make sure that root
is repo root and not file system root? => this is probably the point of the @ convention

Do I still need prettier.config.js for the prettier tailwind plugin?

see if i can do tailwind.config.ts (typescript)
